            Welcome to the website of the <strong> Computer Science Department at George Mason University!</strong>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            With 50 faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the Volgenau School of
            Engineering, one of the largest departments on campus, and one of the largest CS departments in the
            Commonwealth of Virginia.

            Today, not only are computing devices pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost
            every field of endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and engineering.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Given the importance of computing in today's world, we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All",
            i.e., to providing a diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students from all backgrounds and
            of all levels.

            The department offers four M.S. programs in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, <strong> Information
            Systems</strong>, <strong>Information Security and Assurance</strong>, and <strong>Software
            Engineering</strong> with a total enrollment of 400 students.
